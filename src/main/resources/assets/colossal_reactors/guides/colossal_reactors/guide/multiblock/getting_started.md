# Getting started — your first reactor

Build a closed reactor shell, then pick one of the two setups below. Rotate the scene to inspect each face.

## Shell layout

- **Floor and roof**: **Reactor Casing** (closed frame).
- **Vertical corners**: **Reactor Casing** pillars at the four edges (y=1…5).
- **West, east, and south walls**: **5×5 Reactor Glass** panel on each face (five rows × five columns between the corner pillars).
- **Controller face** (north in the example): **no shell blocks** around the controller — only the **Reactor Controller** protruding outward as a **single block**, plus **ports** on that same face where needed (replacing what would be glass on the other walls).
- **Ports**: on the **same wall as the controller** — they can sit **anywhere** on that face (the example spreads them away from the controller on purpose).

The [Reactor Builder](reactor_builder.md) places casing, glass (if in buffer), rods, and heat sinks — **not** the controller or ports.

## Complete example

<GameScene zoom="4" interactive={true} background="transparent">
  <ImportStructure src="/assets/assemblies/minimal_reactor_automation.snbt" />
  <IsometricCamera yaw="225" pitch="28" />
</GameScene>

| North face (controller wall) | Block |
|------------------------------|-------|
| Outside center (protruding alone) | [Reactor Controller](reactor_controller.md) |
| Lower-left / lower-right (spread) | Resource Port ×2 |
| Upper-left (spread) | Power Port |
| West / east / south walls | **5×5** glass panels |

Ports are **not** tied to the controller block — any cell on the controller face works. The scene places them **apart** so you can see that.

## Setup 1: Simple energy (RF-only)

Use this when you only want **RF from the reactor** — no steam line, no turbine required.

1. Build the shell and internals (rods + rod controller on top).
2. Place **controller + power port** on one face as in the example (controller **outside**, power port replaces **glass**).
3. Leave the controller **coolant buffer empty** — no fluid coolant is required.
4. Add fuel (controller GUI or hopper/pipe), open controller → **valid** → **ON**.
5. Connect the **power port outside** to an energy acceptor; check **RF/t** &gt; 0.

**Optional automation** (shown in the example): two **resource ports** on the **same face** — configure in each port GUI (**Insert** / **Extract**, filter, medium toggles). See [Resource Port GUI tooltips](resource_port.md) for every button. **Reboot** after changing port modes.

| Port (example positions) | Mode | Filter |
|------|------|--------|
| Lower-left on controller face | **INSERT** | **Fuel only** |
| Lower-right on controller face | **EXTRACT** | **Both** or solid-only |
| Upper-left on controller face | Power Port | — (RF out) |

Manual play works too: skip the resource ports and load fuel by hand in the controller.

## Setup 2: Coolant (steam for a turbine)

Use this when water (or another coolant) should produce **steam** for a [turbine](../turbine/getting_started.md) instead of (or in addition to) direct reactor RF.

1. Build the same shell and place **controller + power port** on one face (power port still useful for any RF the reactor keeps).
2. In the controller, set the **coolant fluid** (typically **water** / steam mode).
3. On the **same face**, add **two more resource ports** (replace **glass** cells):
   - **INSERT** — **Coolant only** (or **Both**) — pipe coolant **in**
   - **EXTRACT** — **Coolant only** — pipe **steam / spent fluid** **out**
4. Keep the **fuel INSERT** and **waste EXTRACT** ports from Setup 1, or handle fuel/waste manually.
5. Pipe **steam** from the reactor **EXTRACT** port into a [turbine resource port](../turbine/getting_started.md) (**INSERT**). Take **RF** from the turbine **power port**.

With enough conversion, reactor **RF/t may drop** while **steam** rises — that is normal. Size the turbine and pipe enough steam; see [Turbine Getting started](../turbine/getting_started.md).

**Reboot** the reactor controller after changing coolant, filters, or port modes.

## Checklist

1. Closed shell: casing floor/roof, corner pillars, **5×5 glass** on three walls; controller face open except ports.
2. **One [Reactor Controller](reactor_controller.md)** on a side face, **alone** outside the shell.
3. **Power port** (+ optional resource ports) on that **same** face.
4. Pick **Setup 1** (empty coolant) or **Setup 2** (coolant loop + turbine).
5. **Redstone Port** is optional.

## Reactor Builder (optional)

1. Builder places **internals + shell** only.
2. **Stop** build, then add controller (outside) and ports on **one** face as in the scene.
3. Validate from the controller.

## Reactor won’t start?

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|----------------|
| Status **Invalid** | Fix shell, rods, or rod controllers (read status line). |
| **ON** but 0 RF/t | No power port or no energy acceptor; or coolant mode without supply/extract path. |
| Stuck **OFF** + redstone port | Redstone / mode on the port. |
| No waste output | Missing **EXTRACT** resource port or wrong filter. |
| No steam for turbine | Coolant not set, starved INSERT, or missing **EXTRACT** coolant port. |
