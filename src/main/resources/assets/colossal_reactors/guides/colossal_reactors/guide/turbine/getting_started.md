# Getting started — your first turbine

Build a closed turbine shell with a rotor and coils inside, then pick one of the two setups below. Rotate the scene to inspect each face.

## Shell layout

- **Floor and roof**: **Turbine Casing** (closed frame).
- **Vertical corners**: **Turbine Casing** pillars at the four edges (y=1…5).
- **West, east, and south walls**: **5×5 Turbine Glass** panel on each face.
- **Divider wall** at **rod-controller height** (y=2 in the example): **Turbine Casing** ring inside and **casing band** on the side walls — this row **cuts through** the 5×5 glass on those three faces.
- **Controller face** (north in the example): **no shell blocks** around the controller — only the **Turbine Controller** protruding outward as a **single block**, plus **ports** anywhere on that same face (spread in the scene).
- **Coil zone** (above the divider): **two layers** of coil blocks — **copper blocks** in the example.
- **Rotor zone** (below the divider): rods, blades, and **Turbine Rod Controller** on the divider layer.

The [Turbine Builder](turbine_builder.md) places the shell, rotor, and coils — **not** the controller or ports.

## Complete example

<GameScene zoom="4" interactive={true} background="transparent">
  <ImportStructure src="/assets/assemblies/minimal_turbine.snbt" />
  <IsometricCamera yaw="225" pitch="28" />
</GameScene>

| North face (controller wall) | Block |
|------------------------------|-------|
| Outside center (protruding alone) | [Turbine Controller](turbine_controller.md) |
| Lower-left / lower-right (spread) | Turbine Resource Port ×2 |
| Upper-right (spread) | Turbine Power Port |
| West / east / south walls | **5×5** glass (split by divider at rod-controller height) |

Like the reactor example: **two resource ports + one power port**, placed **away** from the controller so it is clear they can go anywhere on that face.

## Setup 1: Simple energy (standalone steam)

Use this when **steam already exists** (tanks, another mod, creative) and you only need **RF from the turbine**.

1. Build shell, rotor (rods + blades), coils, and **rod controller** — or use the [Turbine Builder](turbine_builder.md).
2. Place **controller + three ports** on one face as in the example (controller **outside**, ports **spread** on the same face).
3. Configure **two resource ports**: **INSERT** (steam in) and **EXTRACT** (water / spent fluid out). Pipe both on the **outside**.
4. Connect the **power port outside** to an energy acceptor.
5. Open controller → **valid** → **ON**; check **RF/t** and steam use.

| Port (example positions) | Mode | Role |
|------|------|------|
| Lower-left on controller face | Resource Port — **INSERT** | Steam **in** |
| Lower-right on controller face | Resource Port — **EXTRACT** | Water / exhaust **out** |
| Upper-right on controller face | Power Port | RF **out** |

Configure **two resource ports** in their GUIs — hover each button for tooltips ([full list](turbine_resource_port.md)). **Reboot** after changing port modes or rotor layout.

## Setup 2: Coolant chain (reactor steam)

Use this with [Reactor Getting started — Setup 2 (Coolant)](../multiblock/getting_started.md): the fission reactor makes **steam**, the turbine turns it into **more RF**.

1. Build the turbine as in Setup 1 (shell, rotor, coils, controller, ports on **one** face).
2. On the reactor, run **Setup 2**: coolant in controller, **INSERT** coolant + **EXTRACT** steam/spent fluid on the **same face as the reactor controller**.
3. Pipe **steam** from the reactor **EXTRACT** port → turbine **INSERT** resource port. Pipe **water** from the turbine **EXTRACT** resource port to tanks or back to the reactor coolant loop.
4. Take **RF** from the turbine **power port** (reactor power port is optional backup RF).

Match turbine size and blades to reactor steam output — see [Steam, RF, and coils](turbine_generation_and_coils.md). If steam backs up, add capacity, a larger turbine, or more blades.

## Checklist

1. Closed shell: casing floor/roof, corner pillars, **5×5 glass** on three walls (divider cuts one row), controller face open except ports.
2. Valid **rotor** below divider + **two coil layers** above (e.g. copper blocks).
3. **One [Turbine Controller](turbine_controller.md)** on a side face, **outside** the box alone.
4. **Two resource ports + one power port** on the controller face (any positions on that face).
5. Pick **Setup 1** (any steam source) or **Setup 2** (reactor coolant loop).
6. **Redstone Port** is optional.

## Turbine Builder (optional)

1. Builder places **shell + rotor + coils** only.
2. **Stop** build, then add controller (outside) and ports on **one** face as in the scene.
3. Validate from the controller.

## Turbine won’t run?

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|----------------|
| Status **Invalid** | Fix shell, rods, blades, coils, or rod controller (read status line). |
| **ON** but 0 RF/t | No steam supply, no power port, or no energy acceptor. |
| Low RF vs steam in | Too few blades/coils for the steam rate — see [Rods and blades](turbine_rod_and_blades.md). |
| No steam use | Resource port not **INSERT**, or pipe connected on wrong side. |
| Water backs up | Missing **EXTRACT** resource port or no tank/pipe on the outside. |
